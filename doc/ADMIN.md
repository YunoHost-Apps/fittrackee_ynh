After the installation, you can login with the user and password you choose before the installation.

If you have to use the [command line interface (cli)](https://samr1.github.io/FitTrackee/cli.html), you can go like this:

```
 pushd __INSTALL_DIR__/
    source __INSTALL_DIR__/venv/bin/activate
    ftcli [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
 popd
```
