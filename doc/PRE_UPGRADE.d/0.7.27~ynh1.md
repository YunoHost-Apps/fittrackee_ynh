A packaging bug is also fixed, where the weather api key was removed on upgrade for poeple who didn't set it during installation but only after, via the config panel.
If you are in this situation, your api key will be removed one last time during this upgrade (which fixes the issue). The following ones should not have this bug anymore ðŸ¥³

Thanks to @microniko for reporting this bug and to @alexAubin for helping resolving it.
