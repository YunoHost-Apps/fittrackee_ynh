Great news!
Since latest Yunohost version 11.2.5, itâ€™s now possible for FitTrackee to send mails ðŸ¥³

By default, your mail credentials are automatically set with the __DOMAIN__ where your installed FitTrackee.
You can change it in the config_panel (but be sure to save the initial data, in case you want revert your changes).

NB: `nohost.me`/`noho.st`/`ynh.fr` domains are special domains handled by Yunohost. If you installed FitTrackee on a subdomain such as fittrackee.mydomain.nohost.me, emails will be blocked. You will have either to:
    1. install FitTrackee on a "real" domain; or
    2. change your mail credentials in the config_panel.

Donâ€™t hesitate to raise an issue on the [forum](https://forum.yunohost.org/t/fittrackee-self-hosted-outdoor-activity-tracker/24141) or on [Github](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/fittrackee_ynh).

Enjoy this app and thanks to @SamR1 for creating it!
