If you upgrade to this version, it's because you have had a failed upgrade to the 1.1.x release. A new command has been introduced to fix the database for workouts where the file is missing.

The chosen command is this one:
`ynh_hide_warnings $install_dir/venv/bin/ftcli workouts refresh --add-missing-geometry --on-file-error remove-references --per-page 100000 -v`

If you prefer to delete the broken workouts, please don't upgrade and open an issue in the fittrackee_ynh repo, I'll take care :)

After having upgraded to the version 1.0.7, you are welcome to try to upgrade again to 1.1.x.
